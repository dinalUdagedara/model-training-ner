## 1. Submission overview

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Submission to** | **Both** Blackboard (BB) and Google Form are **mandatory**. Failure to submit to both = **zero IPD marks**. |
| **Deadline** | **05 February 2026, 13:00 LK time** |
| **Late (no MC/SC)** | By **06 February 2026, 13:00 LK time** → **10% penalty** |
| **With MC/SC** | Submit on or before **12 February 2026, 13:00 LK time**. Do **not** submit before main deadline if using MC/SC. |
| **Late with MC/SC** | Within 24 hours of 12 Feb (i.e. by **13 February 2026, 13:00 LK time**) → **10% penalty** |
| **After cut-off** | Submissions after the relevant cut-off receive **zero marks** for IPD. |

| 2 | **Formal Requirements Documentation** | 10% | Complete, structured list of functional and non-functional requirements; measurable; aligned with aims; **implemented vs pending** clearly indicated. |
| 3 | **Overall System Architecture** | 10% | System architecture, UI, key components; well-defined, coherent, aligned with requirements and objectives. |
| 4 | **Updated Time Schedule** | 5% | All major tasks, milestones, deadlines; explanation of deviations from original timeline and their impact. |
| 5 | **Prototype** | **45%** | Working prototype showing **key functionalities**; hosted on an appropriate platform and shared with supervisor. |
| 6 | **Video Presentation & Video Demonstration** | 20% | Clarity of both videos; project development; key milestones, challenges, and solutions. |
|   | **Total** | **100%** | |

## 3. Mandatory submission components

All three must be submitted:

1. **Video Presentation** (≈20 minutes)  
   - Recorded presentation covering the required slides (see Section 6).  
   - Upload to **YouTube as unlisted** and share the URL.  
   - If not accessible or corrupted → **zero** for this component.

2. **Prototype**  
   - Working prototype: **Frontend + Backend + AI/ML model** (as applicable).  
   - Source files in a **shared Google Drive folder**; share a **public link**.  
   - If dataset is **public** → no need to upload it.  
   - If dataset is **collected by you** → upload to the same shared folder.  
   - Failure to provide access → **zero** for this component.

3. **Video Demonstration** (5–10 minutes)  
   - **Code explanation:** max **7 minutes**.  
   - **Prototype demonstration:** max **3 minutes**.  
   - Voice-over throughout; upload to **YouTube as unlisted** and share the URL.  
   - Failure to provide access → **zero** for this component.

## 4. Presentation content (20-minute video)

Your presentation must cover:

- **Stakeholders:** Key stakeholders; their roles, interests, and how they influence the project.
- **Formal requirements:** Functional and non-functional requirements; clearly defined, aligned with aims; **implemented vs pending** clearly indicated.
- **System architecture:** Architecture, UI, key components; use diagrams/schematics/design docs.
- **Updated time schedule:** Progress since PPRS; changes to original timeline and reasons.
- **Critical evaluation:** Progress since PPRS and critical evaluation of the development process.

**Guidelines:**  
Clear, concise, logical flow; key points only; visual aids (charts, diagrams); practice to fit **exactly 20 minutes** (content after 20 minutes is not marked). Consistent slide design; readable fonts and contrast. Suggested formats: MP4, MKV.

---

## 5. Prototype guidelines

- Demonstrate **core functionalities** of the project.  
- **Frontend + Backend + AI/ML model** integration expected where relevant.  
- A basic **user interface is required** (may not be final design).  
- Minor errors and incomplete UX are acceptable for a prototype; focus is on **core development progress**.  
- All **source files** for core implementation in a **shared Google Drive folder** with a **public link**.  
- Ensure the prototype is **accessible and runnable** so the supervisor can review it.

## 6. Video presentation slide structure (template)

Use this order and adapt number of slides per topic as needed (e.g. 1 or 2 slides for Research Gap).

| Section | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Title slide** | FYP project title, student name, UoW/IIT ID, supervisor name |
| **Agenda** | In point form |
| **Problem background** | Real-world problem; use citations/graphs/charts where useful |
| **Research problem & research gap** | Research problem, then identified gap; key existing work to justify gap |
| **Identification of project stakeholders** | **Onion diagram**; stakeholder roles and short descriptions |
| **Formal requirements specification** | Functional requirements; non-functional requirements; **what is implemented vs pending** |
| **System design (one slide)** | System design goals; OOAD methodology |
| **Overall system architecture** | High-level architecture; low-level design diagrams; **wireframes** |
| **Updated time schedule** | **Gantt chart** (e.g. as in Chapter 8 IPD thesis template); **explain changes** (why actual ≠ original); reasons for delays or early completion |
| **Progress since PPRS (one slide)** | Clear statement of progress since PPRS |
| **Conclusion (one slide)** | Main takeaways |
| **References** | Alphabetical order; only those cited in the slides |

## 7. Video demonstration (5–10 minutes)

- **Max 7 minutes:** Code/implementation explanation.  
- **Max 3 minutes:** Prototype demonstration (key features and functionalities).  
- **Voice-over** throughout: explain progress, objectives, and technical details.  
- Structure and clarity matter; audio must be clear.  
- Upload to **YouTube as unlisted** and share the URL.

---

## 8. Quick checklist before submission

- [ ] Video presentation (≈20 min) recorded and uploaded to YouTube (unlisted); URL shared.  
- [ ] Video demonstration (5–10 min: ≤7 min code, ≤3 min demo) uploaded to YouTube (unlisted); URL shared.  
- [ ] Prototype hosted and runnable; link shared with supervisor.  
- [ ] All source code in shared Google Drive folder; public link shared.  
- [ ] If you collected the dataset, it is in the same shared folder.  
- [ ] Submitted on **both** Blackboard and Google Form.  
- [ ] Presentation covers: stakeholders (with onion diagram), requirements (implemented vs pending), system architecture, updated Gantt with explained deviations, progress since PPRS, references.
