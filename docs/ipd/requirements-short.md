## Quick checklist

- [ ] Video presentation (~20 min) → YouTube unlisted → URL in BB + Google Form  
- [ ] Prototype (source + optional dataset) → Google Drive shared link → in BB + Google Form  
- [ ] Demo video (5–10 min, code ≤7 min, demo ≤3 min) → YouTube unlisted → URL in BB + Google Form  
- [ ] Submitted in **both** Blackboard and Google Form before deadline  

*Failure to provide working links / access can result in 0 for the affected component.*
