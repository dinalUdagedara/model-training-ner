Description: Development of Basel II Application, Basel II is the second of the Basel Accords,
which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision. The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to
create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about
how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational
risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk
and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves
appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.

The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital
requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage
(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are
Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan
approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.
