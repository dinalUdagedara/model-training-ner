DESCRIPTION
• IPv6, formerly named IPng (next generation), is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP). IP
is a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks
• Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services IPv4 users can move to IPv6 and receive services such
as <label type="Job Specific Skills">end-to-end security</label>, <label type="Job Specific Skills">quality of service</label> (QoS), and globally unique addresses. The IPv6 address
space reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing
by border routers at network edges.
• Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6
addresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPv6 traffic can be enabled globally,
and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPv6 can also be enabled
• The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP
addresses.
• Mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v6 addressing

DESCRIPTION
• Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express feature is a key component of the Cisco
WAAS product portfolio. WAAS Express is a cost-effective, IOS-based, WAN optimization solution
that increases the amount of available bandwidth for small-to-mid-size branch offices and remote
locations, while accelerating TCP-based applications that operate in a WAN environment.



• The Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express software optimizes TCP traffic flows across
a WAN. WAAS Express integrates with native services such as security, NetFlow, and quality of
service (QoS). WAAS Express provides the following benefits:
❖ Bandwidth optimization
❖ Application acceleration
❖ Increase in remote user productivity
❖ Interoperation with existing Cisco WAAS infrastructure
❖ Network transparency
❖ Deployment flexibility with on-demand service enablement
• The Wexp is about the wide Area Application Service on IOS (Router) itself.
• Mainly involves to checks the functionality of optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS,
SMB and Config_sync.

DESCRIPTION
• <label type="Job Specific Skills">Wide Area Application Services</label> (WAAS) is a Cisco Systems technology that improves the
performance of applications on a wide area network (WAN). WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area
File Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at
LAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based
applications on a given network.
• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work
together to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt



to communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so
that they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.
• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to
optimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized
• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform
check.
