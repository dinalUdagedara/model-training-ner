Carnegie Mellon University  2005-2008  RADAR-TM (Reflective Agents with Distributed Adaptive Reasoning-Task Management). Collaborated with a  group to design an intelligent prioritizing action list that dynamically reorders tasks along changing time and activity  contexts. The reordering behavior is learned from experts\' usage of the RADAR action list.  <label type="College Name">Carnegie Mellon University</label>  School Year 2004-2005  ATGen-Arch (Architectural Test Generator: Architecture Specification Subsystem). Collaborated with a group to  architect a subsystem to specify microprocessor properties relevant to architectural test generators. The project  involved the selection of a microprocessor architecture description language (ADL) best suited for generating tests,    the design of an efficient internal data model for storing microprocessor architectural properties, and the creation of  an application programming interface (API) for querying those properties.  <label type="College Name">Carnegie Mellon University</label>  Spring 2005  High-performance Fault-tolerant Distributed Banking System. Collaborated with a group to formally design and  implement an efficient and actively replicated distributed banking system.  <label type="College Name">Columbia University</label>  Summer 2003  A Goal-directed Search for Hard Bin-packing Problem Instances (Term Paper). Presented an initial investigation  of the hard instances of the bin-packing problem leveraging on previous work on the Satisfiability (SAT) problem.  <label type="College Name">Columbia University</label>  Fall 2000  XML Browser for the PalmOS. Created an XML Browser for the PalmOS patterned after the Microsoft Internet  Explorer 5.5 XML Tree View.  <label type="College Name">Columbia University</label>  Fall 1998  Distributed Data Filtering System.
