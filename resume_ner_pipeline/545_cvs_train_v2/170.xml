Also much time was required to port ABB  applications to APIs that were not completely POSIX compliant and it increased the reliance on  single vendor. All these problems could be overcome by using an open source OS like linux  while still maintaining the real time constraints using preempt_rt patch. This was a research  project that studied the properties of preempt_rt patched Linux in real world scenarios and  decided on worst case timings that will satisfy requirements in ABBs robotic applications    Project  Name  Role  Client  Duration  Work Location  Description    Description  CCPU  Software Developer  NOATM  July 2009  Bangalore  This project involved putting realtime embedded Linux on the MPC5200 based CCPU board.  The CCPU is a piggyback board and the application running on it depends on where it is  mounted. This project follows CMMi Level 5 standards.

Such porting does not provide any value  addition to ABB robotics and yet increases time to market.
