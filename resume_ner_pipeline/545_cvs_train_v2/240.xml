Brief Work History    My involvement in the fields of SPED and REHAB extends back to the early 1970\'s.  While an undergraduate student, I was employed as a drug rehabilitation and crisis intervention  counselor and I volunteered as a cub-scout master for a troop that integrated youth with  disabilities into the general troop. My work while achieving my <label type="Degree">M.Ed.</label> and <label type="Degree">Ed.S.</label>, involved the  development and delivery of habilitation and educational services to person with developmental  disabilities. During that period I was a teacher, a director of a community educational program,  and performed research and demonstration activities at Kent State University. While in  Kentucky, I worked towards developing integrated and ""state of the art"" educational and  rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities. Further, I spent two years attempting to assist  persons with disabilities accessing appropriate employment outcomes. Upon returning to Ohio, I  worked with adults that had a college education, to access meaningful and appropriate  employment. In my role as Associate Director and Assistant Professor, my efforts focused on  systematically address education, employment, and transitional issues for persons with the full  range of disabilities. With my return to Kentucky as an Associate Professor of Special  Education, my focus has continued be on transition and employment issues for youth and adults  with disabilities. I have participated in a wide range of transition programs that include  consulting on two educational systems change grants (Kentuckys Transition Systems Change  Project and Kentuckys Severe Systems Change Project). Further, in Kentucky, I have directed  numerous state and federally funded demonstration and research grants in transition and  employment. I consult with the Kentucky Board of Education and the Kentucky Association of  School Boards on a variety of education issues. Until the summer of 2002 I was coordinator of  Kentuckys State Improvement Grant in Special Education (a federal grant designed to improve  special education services throughout the state). Since then, I have directed the special education  and distance education programs in special education, overseen numerous grants and projects,  and taught coursework in special education.
