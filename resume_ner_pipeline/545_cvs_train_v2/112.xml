But his original r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 was a five-page data dump that made the reader really  work to figure how what hed done.  Part of his \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d was that he was good at just about every aspect of senior  management, so defining a brand and honing in on the most relevant achievements was  a challenge. I embraced his multiple talents as assets and positioned him a leader who  delivers bottom-line growth by improving every aspect of business from <label type="Designation">Sales</label> to  <label type="Designation">Operations</label> to <label type="Designation">HR</label>. I built a branding statement and brief introductory profile to set the  expectations of the reader accordingly.    Rather than trying to include all of his accomplishments, I honed in on representative  projects from each of his areas of strength, creating mini case studies that provide insight  into Bradleys management style and proof of his effectiveness. One of his  accomplishments, saving $30M per year in delivery model operations, became a simple  graph that tells an immediate story to the reader.  I wanted to take advantage of Bradleys stellar early career performance as an executive  at a major bank without risking age discrimination. So I created an Early Career  Summary without dates.  Bradleys new resume generated a lot of interest. He landed a <label type="Designation">General Manager</label> position  within three months at a premier HR services firm."
