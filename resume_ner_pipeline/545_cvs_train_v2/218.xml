Day shift shop Leadman for 6 years.    Duties    included hiring of personnel, machine allocation, scheduling man hours for lead time for  projects, training, safety (we went 5-1/2 years without a single incident), customer  relations, and employee relations      Worked with outside machine shops to meet scheduling needs.        Developed fixturing for common projects.        Developed shop standards for setup (CNC) and first article inspection.        CAM programming using mainly NX.    I used CamWorks for the few Solidworks jobs that    came thru the shop.      Setup and maintained communications from servers to CNC machines.        Maintained manual and CNC machines.        Set up automated tool setup sheet (GRIP) to keep track tooling on larger projects.        Worked with tool salesmen for purchasing the right tool for the right job.        Ground form tools for custom shapes.

To the best of my knowledge, we were the only company at that time to try to shoot both  plastic and rubber into a mold at the same time.        Did troubleshooting of existing tooling (cutoff dies) for wear and repair as needed.        Cleaned molds as needed    <label type="Years of Experience">1974 to 1975</label>    <label type="Companies worked at">L and S Prototype</label>, <label type="Location">Elmonte, Ca</label>  <label type="Designation">Machinist</label>        Conventional machining using lathes, mills and hydrotels of aircraft parts (747 landing  gear doors), helicopter parts (government) and general job shop work.
