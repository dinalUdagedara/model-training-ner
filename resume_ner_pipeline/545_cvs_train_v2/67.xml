Project
US EPG Forecast Workbook (FWB) application is designed to support the US Enterprise Partner
Group (US EPG) in producing and maintaining the monthly US sales forecast. It is a transactional
database combined with <label type="Tech Tools">Microsoft Office Excel</label> functionality that enables end users to interact
with the USNAForecast database. Typically, an ATU manager will connect to the corporate network
and download data from the forecast database, which creates an offline forecast workbook. This
data can then be accessed offline, modelled, and changes to certain data fields are subsequently
uploaded back to the forecast database through a CorpNet connection. These changes are then
stored in the online database and subsequently loaded back into upstream systems.
