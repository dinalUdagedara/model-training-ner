William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2006-2007)  Summary of Research and Scholarship:  I am a sociologist of higher education. Through research, writing, and teaching, I have contributed to our  understanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher  education. My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas\xe2\x80\x94what facilitates it and  what impedes it within different types of colleges and universities\xe2\x80\x94and identifies implications for academic  leaders who manage organizational change, knowledge change and professional socialization. Using theories  and methods from sociology, I analyze how organizational, intellectual, political, economic, and professional  interests redefine the content, structure, conduct, and relative legitimacy of academic fields.  \xe2\x80\xa2 Key studies include: the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields; dynamics of  professional socialization across disciplines; tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective  investment; the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education (1975-2000), a pivotal era of  changing societal expectations; forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration.  Serving in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry in  graduate education, leadership development, academic collaboration, and organizational change.  2    PUBLICATIONS  Books  Gumport, P.
