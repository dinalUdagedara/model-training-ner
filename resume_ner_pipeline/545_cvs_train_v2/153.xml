PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE    <label type="Companies worked at">BANK OF AMERICA</label>, <label type="Location">New York, NY</label>    <label type="Years of Experience">2014-2015</label>    <label type="Designation">Software Developer</label>      6 month consulting position working in core <label type="Tech Tools">Python</label> development in the Quartz core team.        Developed a tool for detecting anomalous trading events and displaying them to auditors.        Developing an <label type="Tech Tools">Excel</label> replacement for end-user computing.    <label type="Companies worked at">AMERICAN MEDIA INC. (AMI)</label>, <label type="Location">New York, NY</label>    <label type="Years of Experience">2014</label>    <label type="Designation">Software Architect/Engineer</label>      This was a week-to-week consulting contract for <label type="Job Specific Skills">system design</label>, <label type="Tech Tools">Scala</label> and <label type="Tech Tools">Python</label> programming.        Enhanced a set of web services providing a proprietary back end for AMI\'s in-progress content  management system. The system is written in Scala and needed a set of extensions for both the  ingestion and retrieval systems.        Designed an improvement to AMI\'s proprietary search engine to prevent it from returning links to  properties that were not available to the user performing the search.        Wrote functional tests in Python using AMI\'s proprietary connection library.    <label type="Companies worked at">HELIOS    &amp;    MATHESON</label>,    <label type="Companies worked at">MPHASIS</label>, <label type="Location">New York, NY</label> (subsidiary of <label type="Companies worked at">HEWLETT PACKARD</label>)    <label type="Location">New    York,    NY</label>  <label type="Years of Experience">2014</label>    <label type="Designation">Ontologist</label>      This was a 3-month contract with <label type="Companies worked at">MphasiS</label>. <label type="Companies worked at">Helios &amp; Matheson</label> was the W-2 employer but had no  influence over the work.        Designed an ontology representing a catalog for electrical products as a proof of concept. The  ultimate client was Schneider Electric, a multinational company, on behalf of their Australian  subsidiary <label type="Companies worked at">Clipsal</label>.        Wrote <label type="Tech Tools">SPARQL</label> queries used by a generic Web application so that new product hierarchies, userspecific displays of details, and user-defined ideas of product similarity could be added to the  application solely by changing the ontology, with no programming modifications.    <label type="Companies worked at">LEXISNEXIS</label>, <label type="Location">New York, NY</label>    <label type="Years of Experience">2010  2014</label>    <label type="Designation">Senior Content Architect / Ontologist</label>      Designed a schema in RELAX NG and XML Schema for government agency documents.        Designed and documented modular entity schemas that specify the standard LexisNexis  representations of information about judges, legislatures, expert witnesses, and commercial  organizations. These schemas were delivered in three variants: for editorial use, for the master  repository, and for the internal document bus. Reviewed and updated modules written by other team  members, and led the reviews of my own modules.        Enhanced a widely used schema module for legal citations to handle cases where text explaining the  purpose of the citation appears in separate sections of a document).        Wrote and supported several internal tools for crude XML analysis, generating ""version 0"" schemas  reflecting what is actually present in large samples of existing documents (up to a million documents  per run).        Rewrote the internal schema used by the content team to document our schemas.        Led the development team for the Lexis Content Ontology, a high-visibility, high-pressure, loosely  specified project with a hard deadline for its first version. Learned essentially from scratch the  principles of ontology design, how to convert logical data models from PowerDesigner, and the  Prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 OWL editor.        Delivered six major sub-ontologies based on the entity schema modules and data models,  contributed to all other sub-ontologies, and reviewed all team results, making possible the on-time  delivery of the ontology.        Developed a strategy for migrating all schema development source control from the LexisNexis  legacy system (IBM ClearCase) to Subversion. Identified platform requirements, wrote installation  and migration plans, and communicated strategy to the architecture team. Supported the migration  effort by assisting the other team members with conversion to the new style. The new system has  been essentially problem-free for over a year. Another LexisNexis team has converted to Subversion  following the plans I wrote.        Updated the schemas and conversion instructions for business directories and news items to handle  non-U.S. sources.        Implemented a continuous-build server for schemas analogous to those used for code.    <label type="Years of Experience">2007  2010</label>    <label type="Companies worked at">GOOGLE</label>, <label type="Location">New York, NY</label>  <label type="Designation">Developer Advocate</label> (Internal) (<label type="Years of Experience">2009  2010</label>)      Led <label type="Companies worked at">Google</label> Data API orientation, design review, code review, pre-launch, and new technology  evangelism meetings, as well as answering one-off questions, for about 25 Google service teams,  including Google Book Search, Calendar, Contacts, Spreadsheets, and Webmaster Tools.

Interviewed 35 candidates for software engineering jobs at Google.    <label type="Designation">Senior Programmer Analyst</label> (<label type="Years of Experience">2007  2009</label>)      Designed a backward-compatible standard format for all the errors reported by the Google Data API  engine and the various services that expose GData feeds, and provided a central internal registry of  those errors.        Made extensive modifications to the internal Google Data APIs engine to bring it into full compliance  with HTTP, specifically to support standard concurrency control. These changes have now been  rolled out to essentially all Google Data APIs.
