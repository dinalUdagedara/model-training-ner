Current Research:  American Government: Democracy in Transition (Pearson, under contract)  This book examines the American political system and its institutions as we transform from a  democracy of self-interest to one of increasing transparency and evidence-based decision  making. The book is designed for introductory American Government courses, and therefore  covers, in depth, the framers, constitutional theory, institutions, and participation  while  simultaneously engaging with a student population who may be only vaguely interested in  government.  Linking Science to Decision Making in Environmental Policy: Bridging the Disciplinary Gap (coauthored with Lawrence Becker, The MIT Press, under contract)  This book examines the role of science in moderating interest-based politics in resource  management and environmental stewardship. The manuscript builds a model of science based  policy processes where management decisions are based on stakeholder input but constrained  by scientific efficacy. Ultimately, the project is intended to develop a protocol to maximize crossdisciplinary decision making in environmental policy.  Environmental Deceptions: The Tension between Liberalism and Environmental Policymaking in  the United States (with Kristy Michaud; Albany: State University of New York Press, 2nd edition  under contract)  This book brings together normative analyses and empirical data to explain the structural  limitations liberal society places on environmental improvement. I argue that cultural  ambivalence toward communitarian ethics has made the traditional environmental  infrastructure problematic. The book exposes the subtle tensions that often lead to policy  failure, and suggests that traditional policy models are insufficient to resolve existing  environmental dilemmas in air, water, waste, and energy.
