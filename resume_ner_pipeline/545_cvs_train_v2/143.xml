Widows Kernel  level Winsock programming using windows DDK communicates with the physical Ethernet  connection to which RFID reader is connected. The driver is developed for the new RFID reader to    for Virtual Serial port  class installers for driver. RFID Reader Software, SDK development and testing Gemini Traze  RFID Pvt Ltd. 08/09-09/09(2 months) VB dot net, VC ++ (2008), RFID biometric reader, windows  XP/Vista/2003, Red Hat Linux. 2 The RFID reader software is developed for the biometric RFID  reader connected to PC through LAN or WAN network connection. Events are recorded when  person or inventory places the RFID tag or his hand on the reader. The recorded event is later  downloaded from the reader using the software that is developed to store accessed ones details in  SQL server or Access database. The reader is connected in LAN or WAN to computer through  developed using win32 SDK and C++ as the    using VB .NET for custom software development. Windows CE 5.0 OS image for low cost PDA  (pocket PC) Newland Handhelds 08/07-12/07(5 months) eVC++, windows CE 5.0 platform builder,  LPC 2478 based hardware platform. 3 The windows CE 5.0 operating system image designed is  intended for low cost PDA (pocket PC) with BAR CODE scanner. The operating system image  designed is for ARM7TDMI-S based LPC2478 microcontroller .The windows CE 5.0 BSP for the  intended Pocket PC contains boot code and the following functional bus drivers;I2C, Serial and  parallel and device drivers like LCD display, touch screen, bar code reader, keypad, USB  Master/Slave, FLASH, Block, Camera. Development of Network, USB, FLASH, Block, Serial,  Parallel, Display and camera. Testing the drivers using TUX test and custom testing methods.  Billing software for windows CE 6.0 pocket PC (PDA). Newland Handhelds 04/07-04/07(1 month)  eVC++, winCE SDK for Newland Pocket PC model PT950 SDK.. 2 The billing software reads the  item code from the bar code using bar code reader present in the pocket PC and matches the price  for the item code scanned in the local database. Then it totals up the sum for all items consecutive  scanned and updates bill details with the total price for every token number in the remote database    Project Name Client Duration Environment Team Size Summary  Responsibilities  Project Name Client Duration Environment Team Size Summary  Responsibilities  Project Name Client Duration Environment Team Size Summary  Responsibilities    Project Name Client Duration Environment Team Size Summary  Responsibilities Project Name Client Duration Environment Team Size Summary  NDIS WDM device driver for the RTL 8139D based NIC card designed Newland Handhelds 01/0803/08(3 months) Windows XP/2003/Vista, windows DDK. 2 The NDIS WDM device driver  connects to hardware specific NDIS miniport layer through NDIS protocol layer of driver stack.  The driver uses scatter/gather DMA operation with data stored in ring buffer in order to  communicate with the RTL 8139D network controller connected through PCI Bridge.
