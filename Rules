## Supervisor's Rules / Guidelines for Resume NER Project

### 1. Model Constraints

* **Do not replace the planned model architecture.**

  * Use BiLSTM-CRF as the core sequence labeling model.
  * Do not switch to unrelated models or pipelines.
* **Feature representation upgrades are allowed** if they enhance performance without changing the model structure.

  * Example: Using BERT embeddings as input is acceptable.
  * Example: Adding dropout or adjusting hidden sizes in BiLSTM is acceptable.

### 2. Data and Preprocessing Rules

* **Use the provided dataset** and maintain the existing BIO labeling scheme.
* **Do not artificially augment data** beyond preprocessing steps.
* **Text preprocessing steps allowed:**

  * Remove special characters and unprintable symbols.
  * Standardize punctuation.
  * Convert resumes to plain text (TXT) from original formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX).

### 3. Training Guidelines

* Follow the current pipeline: **Tokenization → Embeddings → BiLSTM → CRF → Prediction**.
* Batch sizes, learning rates, and epoch numbers can be tuned for performance.
* Ensure labels align correctly with tokenized inputs, especially if using sub-word tokenizers.

### 4. Evaluation Rules

* Use `seqeval` or other sequence-labeling metrics to compute:

  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1-score
* Input to evaluation functions **must be lists of lists** (one list per resume / sample).
* Report metrics for each entity type as well as overall micro/macro averages.

### 5. Compliance and Reporting

* **Any model enhancement must be incremental and rule-compliant.**
* Avoid introducing unrelated pre-trained models or architectures outside the scope.
* Always maintain supervisor-informed checkpoints before moving to next enhancements.
* Document each enhancement clearly, including rationale, expected benefit, and observed results.

### 6. Summary

* **Stay in outline:** BiLSTM-CRF model core.
* **Improvements allowed:** Feature representation (BERT embeddings), preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning.
* **No shortcuts:** Do not switch to unrelated end-to-end pre-trained NER systems.
* **Metrics:** Evaluate carefully and report per rules.
